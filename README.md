Test-Retest Reliability of fMRI measures in Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control dataset

## Repo Organization

- all analysis scripts in `code/`
- scripts in `code` write to `out/`
- `in/` contains behavioral data files, subject lists
- files in `in/` are not modified by any scripts

## Key Factors in DMCC Dataset

- trialtype: "high demand" (difficult trials), "low demand" (easy trials)
- run: run1, run2
- task: Axcpt, Cuedts, Stern, Stroop
- session: baseline, proactive, reactive
- wave: wave1, wave2 (wave1 = test, wave2 = retest)

## General Pipeline

- Get the trial-level activation of each voxel:
  - Run `code/timeseries/null_2rpm/run_deconvolve.sh` to detrend the timeseries. The script will read the subject list in `in/` and save the detrended timeseries to `out/timeseries/`.
  - Run `code/timeseries/selav/selav_single_trials.R` to get the trial-level statistics (selective averaging). The script will read the `.gii` files in the GLM output folders in `out/timeseries/`, e.g., `out/timeseries/130518/RESULTS/Stroop/baseline_null_2rpm_wave1/errts_L.gii` (along with `errts_R.gii`), and save the results in `errts_trials_target_epoch.RDS` under the same folder.
- Calculate the univariate or multivariate trial-level statistics for each parcel:
  - Run `code/spatial/univariate_means.R` to get the univariate statistics for each parcel (averaging across all voxels). The script will read the `errts_trials_target_epoch.RDS` files generated in the last step and save the results in `trial-means_schaefer2018_17_400_fsaverage5-parcel_resid-errts.csv` in the same folder.
  - Run `in/behav/write_behav_subjs.R` to generate trial-level behavioral data from `in/behav/orig/` to CSV files like `behavior-and-events_wave13_Stroop.csv` under `in/behav`.
  - Run `code/spatial/multivariate_projections_within-task_cv-sessions.R` to generate univariate and multivariate statistics for reliability analysis. The script reads the behavior CSVs and outputs to a csv like `out/spatial/projections__stroop__rda__n_resamples100__divnorm_vertex__cv_allsess_wave12.csv`
  - Recode "wave2/3" and "wave1/3" to "wave1/2" and gather all three CSVs by `code/spatial/gather_csvs.sh`
  - ~~Run `code/spatial/multivariate_projections_within-task.R` to get the multivariate statistics for each parcel (the output of the linear classifier with voxels as features). The script will also read the `errts_trials_target_epoch.RDS`, but it will save all results in a single `.csv` file in `out/spatial/` (e.g., `out/spatial/projections__stroop__rda_lambda_100__n_resamples100.csv`). The AUC of each classifier will be saved along with the trial-level statistics.~~
- ~~Fit hierarchical models for the statistics:~~
  - ~~Warning: fitting the bayesian model is VERY SLOW and usually some jobs fail at the first run!~~
  - ~~See the comments in `code/inferential/multivariate_group_level.R` for the details of the modeling process.~~
  - ~~Run `code/inferential/group_level.R` to model the univariate statistics. The script will read the `trial-means_schaefer2018_17_400_fsaverage5-parcel_resid-errts.csv` files generated by `code/spatial/univariate_means.R`, and save the `.csv` or `.rds` results to `out/spatial/`.~~
  - ~~Run  to model the multivariate statistics. The script will read the `.csv` file in `out/spatial/` generated by `code/spatial/multivariate_projections_within-task.R`, and save the `.csv` or `.rds` results to `out/spatial/`.~~
- ~~Plotting the effects in the model:~~
  - ~~Run `code/inferential/_plotting.R` for various figures. The script will read the `.csv` or `.rds` results in `out/spatial` generated by `code/inferential/group_level.R` and `code/inferential/multivariate_group_level.R`, and save the figures in `.png` formate under `out/spatial/`.~~
